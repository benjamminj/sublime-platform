Sublime Platform
==========
by Sublime Security

Overview
---------
An open, adaptable email security platform for writing and running custom detection and response rules to block phishing attacks, hunt for threats, and more.

Sublime Platform is free and self-hosted, which means your emails are completely controlled by you and never seen by a third party.

Why?
----------
Modern email security is a one-size-fits-all black box. The same phishing attacks continue to land, and the same legitimate emails continue to get blocked.

The Sublime Platform **gives defenders control over their email environment** and uses an intuitive, interoperable, purpose-built [YARA-like rules language](https://docs.sublimesecurity.com/docs/message-query-language) for sharing new detection rules with anyone else running Sublime.
